## What is this repo all about and why was it created?

### Nutshell:

DevOps is such a new field that after reading about it, doing it in the real world and thinking about it when not doing the two previously mentioned items with enough frequency you start to understand there's a bigger picture. This repo will contain notes, links and code relating to my take of DevOps (this is in prep for getting my AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional Certification, too). However, with the advent of serverless architectures; SysOps and EventOps are at quite the cross roads!

### Random notes that will need to be classified:
