## What is this repo all about and why was it created?

### Nutshell:

DevOps is such a new field that after reading about it, doing it in the real world and thinking about it when not doing the two previously mentioned items with enough frequency you start to understand there's a bigger picture. This repo will contain notes, links and code relating to my take of DevOps (this is in prep for getting my AWS Certified SysOps Admin - Associate. & DevOps Engineer - Professional Certification, too). However, with the advent of serverless architectures; SysOps and EventOps are at quite the cross roads!

### Random notes that will need to be classified:
- Get your company's logo in the ad that your 3rd party providers are using to sell their products.
- My personal def. of what DevOps Engineering is; It's the ability to understand people on your team, hardware, software, users, abusers, costs, time, purpose and human's in the data age (since you need to understand how use big hardware and software to do enterprise level data science, I'm throwing data science info in here too. Also, we need to be learning from all of our data via insights; performance, predictions for systems and users.)
